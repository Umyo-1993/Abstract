Advanced Numerical Methods Notebook
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, Adv_Num.ipynb, contains a collection of Python code for exploring and applying advanced numerical methods. The primary focus of the notebook is to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and visualize the results. It includes an implementation of a numerical method to approximate the solution of a first-order ODE.

Contents
Euler's Method: The notebook demonstrates the use of Euler's method to numerically solve a given first-order ordinary differential equation.

Equation: The specific ODE being solved is not explicitly defined in the provided output, but the method is applied to it.

Implementation: The code calculates approximate values of a dependent variable y at discrete points X and stores them in Y.

Visualization: A plot is generated to visualize the relationship between the calculated X and Y values.

How to Use
Environment Setup: Ensure you have a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook and the necessary libraries installed. The notebook uses matplotlib for plotting.

pip install jupyter matplotlib

Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the Adv_Num.ipynb file.

Run the Cells: Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially. The code will compute the numerical solution and display the results, including the plot.

Example Output
The notebook's output includes the following:

The approximate value of y at a specific point (e.g., x = 1).
